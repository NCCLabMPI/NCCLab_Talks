## Welcome to the NCCLab Talks

The NCClab Talks is a lecture series currently organized by [Yuranny Cabral-Calderin](https://www.yurannycabral-calderin.com/) and hosted by the [Neural Circuits, Consciousness, and Cognition Research Group](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-neural-circuits-consciousness-and-cognition.html), led by Lucia Melloni, at the [Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en.html) in Frankfurt am Main. This series features prominent speakers in the fields of consciousness and cognitive science.







**Upcoming talks**


#### 09.07.2024      &nbsp;16:00 (CEST)   &nbsp; [Dr. Walter Weit](https://walterveit.com/about/)          &nbsp; What are the adaptive benefits of subjective experience?
<details>

<p align="justify"> Abstract: The so-called emergence of a science of consciousness in the 1990s has at best been a science of human consciousness. This talk aims to advance a true Darwinian science of consciousness in which its evolutionary origin, function, and phylogenetic diversity are moved from the field’s periphery to its very centre, thus enabling us to integrate consciousness into an evolutionary view of life. Accordingly, this book has two objectives: (i) to argue for the need and possibility of an evolutionary bottom-up approach that addresses the problem of consciousness in terms of the evolutionary origins of a new ecological lifestyle that made consciousness worth having and (ii) to articulate a thesis and beginnings of a theory of the place of consciousness as a complex evolved phenomenon in nature that can help us to answer the question of what it is like to be a bat, an octopus, or a crow.<br />

#### 12.08.2024      &nbsp;11:00 (CEST)   &nbsp; [Prof. Florian Mormann](https://www.ukbonn.de/en/epileptology/workgroups/mormann-workgroup-cognitive-und-clinical-neurophysiology/)    &nbsp; Concept neurons in the human medial temporal lobe as semantic building blocks for episodic memory.
<details>

<p align="justify"> Abstract: The human medial temporal lobe contains neurons that respond selectively to the semantic contents of a presented stimulus. These "concept cells" may respond to very different pictures of a given person and even to their written and spoken name. Their response latency is far longer than necessary for object recognition, they follow subjective, conscious perception, and they are found in brain regions that are crucial for declarative memory formation. It has thus been hypothesized that they may represent the semantic "building blocks" of episodic memories. 
In this talk I will present data from single unit recordings in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal cortex, and amygdala during paradigms involving object recognition and perception as well as encoding and consolidation of episodic memories in order to characterize the role of concept cells in these cognitive functions.</p>
